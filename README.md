# Learn Embedded Linux with Yocto Project and Build Custom Embedded Linux

![Alt text](./docs/pictures/Embedded%20Linux%20with%20Yocto.png?raw=true "Title")

This project will give you a framework for learning Embedded Linux with Yocto Project. You will learn both Embedded Linux and Yocto Project.

If you follow along you will be able to build and run custom Embedded Linux for your hardware(ofcourse your hardware should be able to run linux).

Here I use the BeagleBone Black as hardware reference platform and QEMU for the emulation.

The project uses:

1. YP CORE : KIRKSTONE 4.0.6 - 2022.12.28
2. Hardware : BeagleBone Black Rev4
3. Build Host : Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
