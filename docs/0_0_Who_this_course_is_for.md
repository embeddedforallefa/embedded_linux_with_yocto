# Who this course is for

This course is for developers with an interest in embedded computing and Linux who want to extend their knowledge into the various branches of the subject.

I assume that student has a basic understanding of the Linux command line, and in the programming examples, a working knowledge of the C and Python languages.

Several chapters focus on the hardware that goes into an embedded target board, and, so, familiarity with hardware and hardware interfaces will be a definite advantage in these cases. I will also provide as much information a possible to make student understand about the hardware concepts.

 If you are new to Linux and Embedded Systems do not worry, I will explain each and every aspect of Embedded Linux development including the Hardware concepts.
