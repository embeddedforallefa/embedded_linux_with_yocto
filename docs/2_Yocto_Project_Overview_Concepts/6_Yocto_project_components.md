## What is bitbake tool?

BitBake is a task scheduler that parses Python and the shell script mixed code.

The code parsed generates and runs tasks that may have a complex dependency chain, which is scheduled to allow a parallel execution and maximize the use of computational resources.

BitBake can be understood as a tool similar to GNU Make in some aspects.
