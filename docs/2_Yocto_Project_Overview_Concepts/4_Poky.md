# What is poky?

Poky is a reference system distribution of the Yocto Project, an open-source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems for embedded devices. Poky serves as a foundation for building embedded Linux distributions using the Yocto Project's tools and infrastructure.

Poky provides a set of pre-configured recipes, layers, and tools that simplify the process of building and customizing Linux distributions for embedded systems. It includes essential components such as bootloaders, kernels, device drivers, libraries, and utilities, allowing developers to create tailored distributions optimized for their specific hardware and application requirements.

By using Poky as a starting point, developers can leverage the Yocto Project's build system, called BitBake, and its metadata format, known as recipes and layers, to define the desired components, configurations, and package selection for their embedded Linux system. Poky also integrates with OpenEmbedded, which provides additional layers and packages that extend the capabilities of the Yocto Project.

Poky serves as a versatile and flexible foundation for building embedded Linux systems, enabling developers to create customized and optimized distributions with ease. It provides a robust framework for managing software components, dependencies, and configurations, empowering developers to focus on their application-specific needs while leveraging the benefits of the Yocto Project's extensive ecosystem.
