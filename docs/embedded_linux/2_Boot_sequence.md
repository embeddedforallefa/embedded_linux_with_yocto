# The boot sequence

The boot sequence is a complex, multi-stage procedure as the modern SOCs have complex non-linear addressable storage.

**Phase 1 â€“ ROM code**:

The code that runs immediately after a reset or power-on has to be stored on-chip in the SoC; this is known as ROM code. It is
loaded into the chip when it is manufactured, and hence the ROM code is proprietary and cannot be replaced by an open source equivalent. 

Usually, ROM code does not include code to initialize the memory controller, since DRAM configurations are highly device-specific, and so it can only use **Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)**, which does not require a memory controller. The ROM code is capable of loading a small chunk of code from one of several pre-programmed locations into the SRAM.

In SoCs, where the SRAM is not large enough to load a full bootloader such as U-Boot, there has to be an intermediate loader called the **secondary program loader (SPL)**.

At the end of the ROM code phase, the SPL is present in the SRAM and the ROM code jumps to the beginning of that code.
