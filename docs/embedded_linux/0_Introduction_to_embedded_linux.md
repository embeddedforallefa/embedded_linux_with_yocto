# Introduction to Embedded Linux

Here we will try to understand:

1. What is Embedded Linux?
2. Where is Embedded Linux used?
3. Why you should learn Embedded Linux?

## What is Embedded Linux?

**Embedded Linux is a version of Linux designed for embedded systems**, such as embedded computers, mobile phones and other electronic devices that require a low-footprint operating system.

Linux is mainly used as general-purpose operating system (GPOS) for PC hardware with Intel x86 architecture such as Ubuntu; the one I am using. Linux quickly evolved into a server operating system providing infrastructure for web servers and networking services.

Advancements made in semiconductor technology have helped to overcome the hurdles for the adoption of Linux in embedded systems. Some of these are:

1. Availability of inexpensive and long-term reliable flash memory devices  which provides the necessary mass storage for the filesystem.
2. Powerful system-on-chips (SoC) designs which has one or multiple general-purpose CPU cores with MMU and peripheral devices on a single chip replacing the microcontroller in embedded applications.

Recently we are seeing an exponential growth in the adoption of Linux for embedded devices. There are many reasons for the rapid growth of Embedded Linux. Some of there are:

1. **Royalties**: Unlike traditional proprietary operating systems, Linux can be deployed without any royalties.

2. **Hardware Support**: Linux supports a vast variety of hardware devices including all major and commonly used CPU architectures: ARM, Intel x86, MIPS, and PowerPC in their respective 32-bit and 64-bit variants.
3. **Networking**: Linux supports a large variety of networking protocols. Besides the ubiquitous TCP/IP, virtually any other protocol on any physical medium is
implemented.
4. **Modularity**: A Linux OS stack is composed of many different software packages. Engineers can customize the stack to make it exactly fit their application.
5. **Scalability**: Linux scales from systems with only one CPU and limited resources to systems featuring multiple CPUs with many cores, large memory footprints, several networking interfaces, and much more.
6. **Source Code**: The source code for the Linux kernel, as well as for all software packages comprising a Linux OS stack, is openly available.
7. **Developer Support**: Because of its openness, Linux has attracted a huge number of active developers, and those developers have quickly built support for new hardware.
8. **Commercial Support**: An increasing number of hardware and software vendors, including all semiconductor manufacturers as well as many independent software vendors (ISV), are now offering support for Linux through products and services.
9. **Tooling**: Linux provides large number of tools for software development ranging from compilers for virtually any programming language to a steadily growing number of
profiling and performance measurement tools important for embedded systems development.

## Where is Embedded Linux used?

The phone you are using could be powered by A flavour of Embedded Linux(Android). It could be TV that you watch or Smart watch you wear or Tablet PC that you hold. Any of these device could be running Embedded Linux.

With the rise of Internet of Things, there is a great need for devices which are smart and need to connect with internet. For this, you need an operating system tht is powerful, configurable and has small footprint. Yes, Embedded Linux is the answer.

Some devices that run Embedded Linux include:

1. Mobile phones
2. Smart TVs
3. Wireless routers
4. Tablet PCs
5. Navigation devices
6. Other industrial and consumer electronic equipment

To run any flavor of embedded Linux, it usually requires the processor to contain a memory management unit (MMU) with sufficient RAM and ROM.

In general we can classify embedded devices in to 3 categories according to the their size.

1. **Small**: Small systems are characterized by a low-powered CPU with a minimum of 4 MB of ROM (normally NOR or even NAND Flash rather than a real ROM) and between
8 and 16 MB of RAM.
2. **Medium**: Medium-size systems are characterized by a medium-powered CPU with 32 MB or more of ROM (almost always NOR flash, or even NAND Flash on some systems able
to execute code from block-addressable NAND FLASH memory devices) and 64â€“128 MB of RAM.
3. **Large**: Large systems are characterized by a powerful CPU or collection of CPUs combined with large amounts of RAM and permanent storage.

You can run Embedded Linux smoothly on medium and large systems given it has MMU with sufficient RAM, ROM and frequency.

In recent years you can see more and more devices are made using SoCs which has MMU with sufficient RAM, ROM and frequency. This has lead to the adoption of Embedded Linux to power these devices.

## Why you should learn Embedded Linux?

With the rise of Internet of Things and adoption of Embedded Linux in to more devices, there is a great need for professionals who can build things using Embedded Linux.

With the skill to build and run Linux on these Embedded Devices, it open a plethora of opportunities to Contribute and grow the industry.

I am here to help you in mastering Embedded Linux. In this project I will take you through the necessary theory and practical examples so that you lean, build and run Embedded Linux on your device.
