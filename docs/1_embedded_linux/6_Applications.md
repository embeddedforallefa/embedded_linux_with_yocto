# Applications

Everything that runs in **User Space** is an Application.

Some of the Applications are:

1. Navigation
2. Sensor data capture
3. Controlling an actuator and many more.

For developing applications you need software development kit(SDK) as it is more convenient to use SKD for cross platform development.
